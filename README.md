# Planar Inductor 3D Model Generator

Generates 3D models of planar inductors used in integrated circuits. This program helps to reduce modeling time of planar inductors in 3D Modeling CAD software.

**Still in development.**

## Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run either `main.py` or `generator_live.ipynb`.

## Future
- Implement infinite layers.
